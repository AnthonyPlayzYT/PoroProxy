**First**, go to the Main Bot folder, go into index.js, and put your bot token in. Then, go into the Sub Bot 1 Folder, go into index2.js, and edit the bot token. Then, go to the Sub Bot 2 Folder, open index3.js and edit the token. (Please edit these with text editor's! Don't open them as a JavaScript file.)

**Second**, Edit the code in the sub bots which will be the actual bots. Remember to still keep the main bot online. You can add code into both sub bots, as long as they are both running. DO NOT edit the main bot, you can, but it doesn't look much like a proxy if you do.

**Third**, launch all the EXE files to load the bots online, and your done. Enjoy!
